# Mission kinda
Exploring all that is possible. Melding interestings and experiance into one dev enviroment. Might split it up or might make a mega project... who knows. Ultimately looking to explore web, server, native and game development. Using AI/Machine learning assisted bleeding edge CI/CD workflows? Or perhaps simply integrating AI into FE, BE, Native and beyond.
