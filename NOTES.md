# Explore
- [] Frontend in TS or Kotlin?
- [] Web assembly
- [] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea1zJD5uQRg CODE FLOW - but how does that work with complex apps with FE and BE?
- [] Backend in TS or Kotlin?


## Development
- [] Docker dev enviroments, Kubernetes? Minikube? Devspace?
- [] Mono repo structure
- [] Micro Frontends
- [] Common code
- [] independent packge defintions? Package, API, APP and/or global? - GUT says no this was hard to maintain in PixelOven
- [] Mockoon or some eq? 
- [] Swagger

## CI/CD
- [] Code flow
- [] Code cov
- [] Gihub actions
- [] Huksy? Pre commit
- [] Prettier
- [] Eslint strict and conencted to prettier also does it like TypeScript?

## AI / Machine Learning
- [] Stable Diffusion
    - Docker https://github.com/fboulnois/stable-diffusion-docker for https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion
    - https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion

## Other
- [] Game development (At least Web based support)
- [] Native
- [] Translations (server side and ideally static page support)
- [] Kong for access control
- [] Can we have server rendered and static render apps live side by side?
- [] Minikube in CI?
- [] Minikube or K8 env for running Code flow against?

# Mission kinda
Exploring all that is possible. Melding interestings and experiance into one dev enviroment. Might split it up or might make a mega project... who knows. Ultimately looking to explore web, server, native and game development. Using AI/Machine learning assisted bleeding edge CI/CD workflows? Or perhaps simply integrating AI into FE, BE, Native and beyond.
