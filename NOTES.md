# Explore
- [] Frontend in TS or Kotlin?
- [] Web assembly
- [] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea1zJD5uQRg CODE FLOW - but how does that work with complex apps with FE and BE?
- [] Backend in TS or Kotlin?


## Development Enviroments
- [] Docker dev enviroments, Kubernetes? Minikube? Devspace?
- [] Microservices, common code, mono repo


## CI/CD
- [] Code flow
- [] Code cov
- [] Gihub actions

## AI / Machine Learning
- [] Stable Diffusion
    - Docker https://github.com/fboulnois/stable-diffusion-docker for https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion
    - https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion

## Other
- [] Game development (At least Web based support)
- [] Native

# Mission kinda
Exploring all that is possible. Melding interestings and experiance into one dev enviroment. Might split it up or might make a mega project... who knows. Ultimately looking to explore web, server, native and game development. Using AI/Machine learning assisted bleeding edge CI/CD workflows? Or perhaps simply integrating AI into FE, BE, Native and beyond.
